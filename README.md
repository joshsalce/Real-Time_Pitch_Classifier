# UCSD Baseball 2023 Pitch Classifier

## Description
This is a locally run web-application that can classify pitches in real-time based on which pitcher is in a game. Using the socket.io package in JavaScript, a pitcher can be selected from a dropdown-menu. After pressing "Start," an sklearn model is built on the pitcher's Yakkertech pitch data, and a  Python connection to the Yakkertech cameras is established using the socketIO-client pacakge that is continuously parsed to read and predict on incoming pitch data. Each prediction is written from a Python localhost client to the front-end HTML page in the style that an MLB stadium shows pitch data.
